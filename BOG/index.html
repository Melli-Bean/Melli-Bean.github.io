    <H3>Chapter I</H3>
    <P>	In the beginning there was nothing. Suddenly there was something. Our story starts way after that. Our story starts with a boy. This boy was very ordinary, but would do great things later in his life.
	The boy’s name was Greyson. He was interested in learning all he could. He had many wonders about many aspects of life. He wanted knowledge.
	He wasn’t some special saint. He was just a boy who wanted to hear what everyone wanted to say.
	He excelled in school, keeping his grades up while always having the time to interact with other kids. He was raised very well. People respected him, and they were given his respect too.
	By the time he was 12, he knew quite a lot. He was knowledgeable in social constructs and the human mind. He had a knack for researching anything he could.
	But when he was 17, his biggest interest revealed itself to him
</P>
    <H3>Chapter II</H3>
    <p>	When he turned 17, he took an interest in meditation. He wanted to explore the deepest parts of his mind. Learning about the in and outs of the brain, discovering feelings hidden, lost in the unconscious.
	During one of these sessions, the boy came across a figure. It was feminine yet had no solid form, closer to an idea than a thing. He reached out to her and asked “What are you?”
	The idea took a second to respond. As it stared back at Greyson it said, “I am the psychopomp. I’ve helped guide you through your entire life. You’ve grown to be very wise, just as I hoped. Your kindness has inspired others and you’ve impressed me. I’d like you to spread your kindness to everyone you meet.”
	Greyson didn’t know what to say. As he slowly walked towards her, he began to open his mouth to speak. But before any words came out, she closed his mouth for him.
	“No need to speak to me, young one.” she whispered. “I know you wish to speak, so speak of me to others. Let the world know my name. Inspire the people with your voice. Let our ideas run free. Make the world a better place.
	His thoughts began to race. He had trouble focusing. His eyes suddenly opened and he was hit with a bright light.
