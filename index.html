    <p>Pompology is a new religion focusing on helping you connect with your unconscious mind to help better yourself and understand yourself more as a person.</p>
<p>We worship the Psychopomp, a feminine guide to help us through life. We practice active imagination, a form of meditation, to help us connect with her and with ourselves.</p>
<p>You will be surrounded by supportive people who are looking to find themselves and help others do the same. We are a tight-knit community with the goal of uplifting everybody.</p>
